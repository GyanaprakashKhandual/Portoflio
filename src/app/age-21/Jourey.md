# My New Life Principles

Maybe I can never truly forget, and I have no proof that I'm completely over it — I still love her. But I have moved on. She never said "I love you." All of that was meaningless. I don't want to go back to that place. But I will try to change, and I know that I _can_ change. I will follow these points in my life, and no matter what happens, I will move forward with these principles. I will not play the victim, nor will I pretend. I will follow these things in my life. These are my promises:

---

1. Don't touch any girl or woman in any way, even if you are in a relationship. Respect their boundaries and personal space.

2. Don't engage in unnecessary conversations or interactions with women. Keep all contact minimal and purposeful.

3. Build only professional relationships and focus your energy on your work and financial goals.

4. Don't share your personal feelings, thoughts, or emotions with anyone.

5. Don't fall in love with anyone. If a girl likes you, loves you, or asks you out, clearly say no — and conduct yourself in a way that discourages any such interest. This is the most important rule to learn and apply in your life.

6. Don't lie to anyone — not to a single person in your life.

7. Start caring about everyone — men, women, anyone you meet. Love them, support them, and try to help every single person you encounter — until they hurt you.

8. The most important thing to be clear about: don't fall in love with anyone. Don't allow any romantic attraction. Don't do anything that could lead to feelings of attraction.

9. Things like a man being caring, loving, strong, and protective are myths and lies. Don't believe in these ideals, and don't try to live up to them — because you will only get hurt and disappointed.

10. Focus on your personal growth, career, and self-improvement. Invest your time and energy in developing your skills, pursuing your passions, and building a fulfilling life for yourself.

11. Surround yourself with positive and supportive people who respect your boundaries and encourage your personal growth.

12. You will have an arranged marriage. When that time comes, be open and honest with her — tell her everything about your past, and clear everything up. Only marry her if she still says yes after knowing it all.

13. Be caring, loving, protective, and everything a woman needs in a partner. Have all those qualities — be funny, be emotionally strong, physically strong, and mentally resilient.

14. Don't be a player. Don't be a flirt. Don't be a cheater, a liar, a manipulator, or a disloyal partner.
15. Don't be a victim. Don't be a coward. Don't be a weak person. Don't be a pushover. Don't let anyone walk all over you.
16. Don't do any thing to impress any one. Whatever you thing it's best for your professional life.
